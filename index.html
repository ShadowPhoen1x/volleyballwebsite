    <h3>What is Volleyball?</h3>
    <p> Indoor Volleyball is played by two teams of 6 players on either side, in which the players use their hands to bat a ball back and forth over a high net. The aim of the game is to get 
        the ball to touch the oppositions side of the court without it being returned. To prevent this a player on the opposing team digs the ball up toward a teammate before it touches the court surface
        that teammate may then volley it back across the net or bat it to a third teammate who volleys it across the net. A team is allowed only three touches of the ball before it must be returned over the net.

      <p>A Dig is the "passing" or "receiving" of the volleyball and is usually how the first touch of the ball will be passed to the setter.</p>

      <p>Setting is almost always the second touch of the ball and is the pass to set the ball up to allow the spiker to hit the ball into the oppostions court. </p>

      <p>The spike is ideally the 3rd and final touch of the ball. It's an attacking play where you hit the ball downwards at the oppotions court</p>
