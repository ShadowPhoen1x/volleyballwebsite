        <h1>Volleyball</h1>
    <h3>What is Volleyball?</h3>
    <p> Indoor Volleyball is played by two teams of 6 players on either side, in which the players use their hands to bat a ball back and forth over a high net. The aim of the game is to get 
        the ball to touch the oppositions side of the court without it being returned. To prevent this a player on the opposing team digs the ball up toward a teammate before it touches the court surface
        that teammate may then volley it back across the net or bat it to a third teammate who volleys it across the net. A team is allowed only three touches of the ball before it must be returned over the net.
